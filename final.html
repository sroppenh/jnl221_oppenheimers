			<h2>TSA Complaints Surge After Pandemic</h2>
			<h1>Since the Covid-19 Pandemic, complaints have surged while passenger traffic fails to bounce back.</h1>

			<p><strong>The process of going through security at airports is a necessary but often arduous task. With long lines, often short-staffed security checkpoints, and seemingly ever changing rules, it is no mystery why the process’s (and its administrative authority’s) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellistalton/2019/01/28/is-the-tsa-really-necessary/?sh=322d54cb25e0" target="_blank">public perception is negative</a>. With the rebound of passengers using air travel after the pandemic, it’s no wonder the complaints have surged as well. According to data collected by the Data Liberation Project, an organization focused on organizing government datasets into readable formats, over 150,000 complaints were filed with the TSA in 2022, with many complaints in unexpected places.</strong></p>

				<h3>TSA Pre-Check makes up 80% of TSA Complaints</h3>
				<p>As passenger travel rates rise after the pandemic, many people are opting in to the TSA’s “Expedited Passenger Screening Program”, or Pre-Check, as it’s better known. Since 2015, <strong>Pre-Check enrollment has surged by 800%</strong>, according to TSA Spokesperson Daniel Velez. <br><br>“I think the majority of the reason why we're seeing more complaints is that there's just more and more people that are getting into the program. We’re up to 18 million now” Velez said in a recent interview. “We’ve also opened up many more opportunities to voice complaints and opinions, which is another reason.”<br><br>Even with this boom, <strong> than 5% of all airport travelers were enrolled in Pre-Check in 2022, despite 80% of all TSA complaints being pre-check related.</strong><br><br>The next most reported complaint category was <strong>Customer Service, which made up a total of 6% of the complaints.</strong>

			<h3>Traffic as a Whole</h3>
			<p>Though TSA complaints are on the rise, Airport traffic has not yet bounced back to pre-pandemic numbers. In data released by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, it was revealed that <strong>Airport Passenger Traffic has decreased by more than 25% since 2018</strong>, with 49 of the 50 states seeing a state specific decrease. This excludes Delaware, who experienced a total increase of 4,000 passengers, 800% higher than their airport population in 2018. <strong>This is in direct contrast to the amount of complaints, which have increased by over 40% since 2018</strong>.

			<h3>Understanding the Surge</h3>
			<p>Though the TSA has been releasing statistics and press reports to the Department of Transportation on their complaints since 2009, <strong> in late 2020 did the two departments optimize their data reporting for further accuracy. This being in the middle of the pandemic, it makes sense the numbers surged soon after, despite the less than full return to airports.</strong> <br><br>“Prior to October 2020, there was no methodology in the reporting and there was no historical knowledge or framework about the origins of the inter-departmental reporting,” the agency told <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/tsa-passenger-complaints-report" target="_blank">Conde Nast Traveler</a>. “Both agencies agreed that changes were necessary to ensure that the report provided a complete and comprehensive overview of TSA Contact Center complaint activity.”<br><br>The optimized data first appeared in the TSA’s March 2022 Report, which used data from January of that year. This, along with the return of passengers to airports as Covid restrictions were slowly lifted, could explain the <strong>more than 100% increase in complaints from 2021 to 2022. </strong>

			<h3>The Issue of Data</h3>
			<p>While the TSA takes steps towards more accessible data, those who try analyzing the data say it’s not enough. Jeremy Singer-Vine, founder of The Data Liberation Project, says the file format of the reports presents a unique challenge for analysis. <br><br>“All the data was trapped in PDFs, which can’t be edited by any simple means.” Singer-Vine said in a recent interview. “So by-hand analysis would have been monstrous. To make matters worse, the layout is entirely non-standard, making copy-pasting into a spreadsheet impossible. The format TSA currently publishes lacks any real way to be analyzed without extensive amounts of busywork, which greatly lowers its value to the public.”<br><br>It should be noted that other datasets released by the Department of Transportation, such as the <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/air-travel-consumer-reports-2022" travel="_blank">Air Travel Consumer Reports</a>, are also published in PDF format, but in a standard, machine readable spreadsheet layout as compared to the TSA Complaint Reports

			<h3>How To File a Complaint with TSA</h3>
			<p>In recent years, the TSA has opened several more outlets to voice complaints in, including a live chat service and an email system.
			<br><br>“We’ve opened quite a few outlets,” Velez said in a recent interview, “What the passenger will do if they have a complaint, they can chat live with somebody on tsa.gov, e-mail TSA, or they can give us a call at the Customer Care Center. We have people around the clock that are there to listen to the individual and take down their complaints. We speak with our TSO's that are involved in any warranted complaint and we try to remedy the best that we can, whether through an apology or something else to remedy the customer along the way.”
			<br><br><strong> passengers can contact either by email at TSA-ContactCenter@tsa.dhs.gov or by telephone at 866-289-9673, on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET, or weekends and holidays form 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.. To file a complaint online, <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/contact-center/form/complaints" target="_blank"> click here</a></strong>
